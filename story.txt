 story about miniature goggles. It is odd they need to be miniature, because most people who need goggles are not terribly small
but we'll make it out like a very small person needs really cool goggles to make the world normal sized. This is a story of, we'll
call him the small man with miniature goggles, is able to experience a normal world due to these amazing miniature goggles that can
not only fit on his face, but make it seem like the world is "normal sized" (as a normal sized human would see it). This begs many
questions, as well as the need for a good story. Let's say this good story takes
place where you would expect someone like this to be: Washington D.C.
